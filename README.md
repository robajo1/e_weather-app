Error Handling: Handles API errors and provides user-friendly messages.
Technologies Used
Flutter: For building the cross-platform mobile app.
Dart: The programming language used in Flutter.
flutter_dotenv: For managing environment variables securely.
http: For making API requests.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Flutter SDK installed (Installation Guide)
A valid API key from a weather service provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
Installation

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
Add an .env file in the root directory and include your API key:

env
Copy code
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Update the pubspec.yaml file to include .env as an asset:

yaml
Copy code
flutter:
  assets:
    - .env
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Run the app:

bash
Copy code

How It Works
The app loads the API key from the .env file using the flutter_dotenv package.
It makes an HTTP request to fetch weather data for a specific location.
The response data is parsed and displayed in the app’s UI.
